<h1>MySql to Socrata</h1>
<p>Working with MySql is actually very straightforward and thanks to the work that has been done by the <a href = "https://github.com/rstats-db/rmysql">RStats-db<a/> team we can take advantage of this for Socrata data. RMySQL is a database interface and MySQL driver for R. This version complies with the database interface definition as implemented in the package DBI 0.2-2.

 
<p>install.packages("RMySQL") is the package that you will need in order to set this up.</p>

con <- dbConnect(MySQL(),
    user = 'RDSUser',
    password = 'YourPass',
    host = 'RDS Host',
    dbname='YourDB')

dbReadtable allows us to read from an MySQL database after we have established a connection to the system
