description: This FME template workflow enables writing geospatial data read into FME (using an FME Reader) to an existing Socrata Geospatial Dataset (a.k.a. Mondara Dataset). Use cases include automating publishing geospatial data (including polygons, lines, and points) to Socrata from a Shapefile or geospatial database, as well as optionally transforming, modifying, or adding attributes prior to publishing using FME transformers. <a href="#" target="_blank">View workflow preview</a>
